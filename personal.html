        <h3>The first day at ITB</h3>
        <p>My first day at ITB was scary. The first time seeing the campus was surreal feeling. I was going into college only knowing two other people in my course (we went to the same school but we wouldnt have been close). I truly didn't know what to expect in college, i just knew it would be a fresh start for me and i could finally be myself compared to in school.</p>
		<p>Once I stepped into F block I was lost (the room ended up being right in front of me).When I walked into the class, I was overwhelmed by the amount of unfamilar faces I was seeing. After a while, I was able to start to take everything in, thats until we went on a campus tour! As soon as that started I realized how quickly id have to adapt in order to find my classes and be on time. While on this tour, I started talking to Darragh we clicked immediatly due to our nervousness. We ended up stiking to together since.</p>
		<p>What I remember most about my first day at ITB was how many Macs there were and how excited i was to be able to use them. Also the free food! (I wish it was still free, the price of food is ridiculous)</p>
